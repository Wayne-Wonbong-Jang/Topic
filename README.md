# Topic
I will upload some of the important topics in ML using (mainly) Pytorch, Numpy and Colabatory

# PCA : Implement PCA using PyTorch and use it to decompose MNIST images
# NN_with_PyTorch : Making Neural Network using Numpy style
# MNIST_CVAE: Implement VAE & Conditional VAE for MNIST images
# WGAN_MNIST_Pytorch_Classification: Implement WGAN-GP for MNIST images, and also train the Discriminator(Critic) to classify the images from 0 to 9. Neural Network can learn to classify the MNIST generated or real, and it can classify the image into one of the labels at the same time.
